The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is referenced by all other files that import or require these dependencies.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler. It is referenced by all `.tsx` files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages. It wraps around all other pages.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is a custom Document component that is used to augment the application's html and body tags. It is referenced by all other pages.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are applied to the entire application. It is imported in `_app.tsx`.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is the website's favicon and is used in the `_document.tsx` file.

10. **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files but is crucial for the project setup.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files but is crucial for the project documentation.
